This repository is dedicated to the Yantra hack project, which focuses on implementing a machine learning solution for verifying the authenticity of products. The core functionality revolves around a sophisticated model capable of analyzing images and generating accurate textual descriptions of their contents. This image-to-text capability becomes instrumental in cross-referencing and validating the information provided by users against the actual title or description of a product. By leveraging the model's capabilities, the system ensures a comprehensive and reliable verification process that enhances trust and accuracy in product authenticity assessments.
